    "1.4 Control Flow\n",
    "=====\n",
    "***\n",
    "* The colon character is used to delimit the beginning of a block of code that acts as a body for a control structure.\n",
    "* Python relies on the identation level to designate the extent of that block of code, or any nested blocks of code within.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.4.1 Conditionals\n",
    "-----\n",
    "***\n",
    "In Python, the most general form of a conditional is written follows:\n",
    "> __if__ _first condition_:<br>\n",
    ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_first body_<br>\n",
    ">__elif__ _second condition_:<br>\n",
    ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_second body_<br>\n",
    ">__elif__ _second condition_:<br>\n",
    ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_second body_<br>\n",
    ">__elif__ _third condition_:<br>\n",
    ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_third body_<br>\n",
    "> __else__:<br>\n",
    ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_fourth body_\n",
    "\n",
    "* The execution of this overall construct will cause precisely one of the bodies to be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.4.2 Loops\n",
    "-----\n",
    "***\n",
    "* A __while__ loop allows general repetition based upon the repeated testing of a Boolean condition.\n",
    "* A __for__ loop provides convenient iteration of values from a defined series, such as characters of a string, elements of a list, or numbers within a given range.\n",
    "\n",
    "### While Loops\n",
    "* As an example, here is a loop that advances an index through a sequence of characters until finding an entry with value 'X' or reaching the end of the sequence.\n",
    "    * The `len` function returns the length of sequence such as a list or string.\n",
    "    * Had we written that compound condition with the opposite order, the evaluation of data[j] would eventually raise an `IndexError` when 'X' is not found.\n",
    "    * This code behaves correctly, even in the special case when the list is empty, as the condition `j < len(data)` will initially fail and the body of the loop will never be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "> j = 0<br>\n",
    "> __while__ j < len(data) __and__ data[j] != 'X':<br>\n",
    "> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Loops\n",
    "* The for-loop syntax can be used on any type of __iterable__ structure, such as a `list`, `tuple`, `str`, `set`, `dict`, or `file`.\n",
    "* There is no need to manage an explicit index into the list nor th author a Boolean loop condition.\n",
    "* We can use a for loop in cases for which a while loop does not apply, such as when iterating through a collection, such as a `set`, that does not support any direct form of indexing.\n",
    "    * The loop body executes once for each element of the data sequence, with the identifier, `val`, from the for-loop syntax assigned at the beginning of each pass to a respective element.\n",
    "    * `val` is treated as a standard identifier. But a reassignment of identifier `val` to a new value has no affect on the original data, nor on the next iteration of the loop.\n",
    "> total = 0<br>\n",
    "> __for__ val __in__ data:<br>\n",
    "> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;total += val\n",
    "\n",
    "### Index-Based For Loops\n",
    "* In some applications, we need knowledge of the index of an element within the sequence.\n",
    "* We prefer to loop over all possible indices of the list. For this purpose, Python provides a built-in class named `range` that generates integer sequences. (`n` values from `0` to `n-1`)\n",
    "    * For examle, we can find the _index_ of the maximum element of a list as follows:\n",
    "> bing_index = 0<br>\n",
    "> __for__ j __in__ range(len(data)):<br>\n",
    "> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__if__ data[j] > data[big_index]:<br>\n",
    "> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;big_indes = j\n",
    "\n",
    "### Break and Continue Statements\n",
    "* Python supports a __break__ statement that immediately terminate a while or for-loop when executed within its body.\n",
    "* It also supports a __continue__ statement that causes the current _iteration_ to stop, but with subsequent passes as expected.\n",
    "    * Here is code that determines whether a target value occurs in a data set.\n",
    "> found = __False__\n",
    "> __for__ item __in__ data:<br>\n",
    "> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__if__ item == targe:<br>\n",
    "> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;found == __True__<br>\n",
    "> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__break__\n"
