    "* Existing values can be combined into larger syntactic __expressions__ using a variety of special symbols and keywords known as **operators**.\n",
    "* In this section, we describe Python's operators in various contexts of the built-in types.\n",
    "* __(compound expressions)__ Python defines a specific order of precedence for evaluating operators, and it allows a programmer to override this order by using explicit parentheses to group subexpressions.\n",

    "| __!=__ | not equivalent |\n",
    "\n",
    "* The expression `a is b` evaluates to __True__, precisely when identifiers `a` and `b` are aliases for the _same_ object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison Operators\n",
    "| __Operator__ | __use__ |\n",
    "|:-------:|:--------------:|\n",

    "| __//__ | integer division |\n",
    "| __%__ | the modulo operator |\n",
    "\n",
    "* In Python, the / operator designates __true division__, returning the floating-point result of the computation.\n",
    "* Python supports the pair of operators // and % to perform the integral calculations. (the mathematical _floor_ of the quotient, the remainder of the integer division)\n",
    "* Python extends the semantics of // and % to cases where one or operands are negative or even floating-point. It guarantees that `q*m + r` will equal `n`. (`n: dividend`  `m: divisor`  `r: remainder`  `q: the integral floor of n/m`)\n",

    "\n",
    "* Python relies on __zero-indexing__ of sequences, and supports the use of __negative indices__;  index -1 denotes the last element, index -2 the second to last, and so on.\n",
    "* Because lists are mutable, lists also supports a syntax `del s[j]` that removes the designated element from the list.\n",
    "* The notation `val in s` can be used for any of the sequences to see if there is an element equivalent to `val` in the sequence.\n",
    "* All sequences define comparison operations based on __lexicographic order__, performing an element by element comparison until the first difference is found.\n",
