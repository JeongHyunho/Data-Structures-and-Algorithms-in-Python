    "1.2 Objects in Python\n",
    "=====\n",
    "***\n",
    "* Python is an object-oriented language and **classes** form the basis for all data types.\n",
    "* Python has built-in classes, such as the **int** class for integers, the **float** class for floating-point values, and the **str** class for character strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.2.1 Identifiers, Objects, and the Assignment Statement\n",
    "-----\n",
    "***\n",
    "*  Bellow command establishes <span style=\"font-family:Gothic;\">temperature</span> as an **identifier** (also known as a **name**), and then associates it with the **object**.\n",
    "*  The **identifier** <span style=\"font-family:Gothic;\">temperature</span> references an instance of the <span style=\"font-family:Gothic;\">float</span> class having value <span style=\"font-family:Gothic;\">98.6</span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><code style=\"font-family:Gothic;\"> temperature = 98.6 </code></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identifiers\n",
    "* Each identifier is implicitly associated with the **memory address** of the object to which it refers.\n",
    "* Unlike Java and C++, Python is a. **dynamically typed** language, as there is no advance declaration associating an identifier with a. articular data type.\n",
    "* Although an identifier has no declared type, the object to witch it refers has a definite type (e.g., a floating-point literal).\n",
    "* When an **alias** has been established, either name can be used to access the underlying object.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><code style=\"font-family:Gothic;\"> original = temperature </code></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "* However, if one of the names is reassigned to a new value, that does not affect the aliased object, rather it breaks the alias.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><code style=\"font-family:Gothic;\"> temperature = temperature + 5.0 </code></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "1.2.2 Creating and Using Objects\n",
    "-----\n",
    "***\n",
    "### Instantiation\n",
    "\n",
    "* The syntax for instantiating an object is to invoke the **constructor** of a class.\n",
    "* Many of Python's built-in classes support what is known as a **literal** form for designating new instances.\n",
    "* Another way to indirectly create a new instance of a class is to call a function that creates and returns such an instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calling Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python supports traditional functions invoked with a syntax, and Python's classes may also define one or more **methods** or **member function**.\n",
    "* We can use the dot operator to invoke a method upon the immediate result of some other operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><code style=\"font-family:Gothic;\"> response.lower().startswith('y') </code></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some methods known as **accessors** return information about the state of an object, but do not change that state.\n",
    "* Other methods known as **mutator** or **update methods** , such as <span style=\"font-family:Gothic;\">sort</span> method, do change the state of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.2.3 Python's Built-In Classes\n",
    "-----\n",
    "***\n",
    "* A class is **immutable** if each object of that class has a fixed value upon instantiation that cannot subsequently be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   Class   |              Description             | Immutable? |\n",

    "### The bool Class\n",
    "\n",
    "* Numbers evaluate to <span style=\"font-family:Gothic;\">False</span> if zero, and <span style=\"font-family:Gothic;\">True</span> if nonzero.\n",
    "* Sequences and other container types, such as strings and lists, evaluate to <span style=\"font-family:Gothic;\">False</span> if empty and <span style=\"font-family:Gothic;\">True</span> if nonempty.\n",
    "* An important application of this interpretation is the use of a non-boolean value as a condition in a control structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The int Class\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python automatically chooses the internal representation for an integer based upon the magnitude of its value.\n",
    "* if  **f** represents a floating-point value, the syntax int(__f__) produces _truncated_ value.\n",
    "* if **s** represents a string, then int(__s__) produces the integral value that string represents. (e.g., int('137') produces value 137)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The float Class\n",
    "\n",
    "* Its precision is more akin to a  <span style=\"font-family:Gothic;\">double</span> in Java or C++, rather than those language's  <span style=\"font-family:Gothic;\">float</span> type.\n",
    "* The floating-point equivalent of an integral number can be expressed directly as 2.0 or 6.022e23 using scientific notation.\n",
    "* If the parameter to the constructor is a string, as with float('3.14'), it attempt to parse that string as a floating-point value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequence Types: The list, tuple, and str Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sequence types represent a collection of values in which the order is significant.\n",
    "* The <span style=\"font-family:Gothic;\">list</span> class is the most general, representing a sequence of  arbitrary objects.\n",
    "* The <span style=\"font-family:Gothic;\">tuple</span> class is an __immutable__ version of the list class, benefiting from a streamlined internal representation.\n",
    "* The <span style=\"font-family:Gothic;\">str</span> class is specially designed for representing an immutable sequence text characters which are just string with length one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The list Class\n",
    "\n",
    "* A list is __referential__ structure, as it technically stores a sequence of __references__ to its elements.\n",
    "* The contents of a list literal need not only be expressed as literals, but also be identifiers already established.\n",
    "* The constructor accept any parameter that is of an __iterable__ type. (e.g., list('hello') produces a list of individual characters, ['h','e','l','l','o'])\n",
    "\n",
    "### The tuple Class\n",
    "\n",
    "* Its instances have an internal representation that may be more streamlined than that of a list.\n",
    "* To express a tuple of length one as a literal, a comma must be placed after the element, but within the parentheses. (e.g., not (17), but (17,))\n",
    "\n",
    "### The str Class\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python's str class is specifically designed to efficiently represent an immutable sequence of characters.\n",
    "* The backslash must itself be escaped to occur as a natural character of the string literal, as in 'C:\\\\\\\\Python\\\\\\\\', for a string displayed as C:\\Python\\\\.\n",
    "* Triple-quotoed strings have advantage that newline characters can be embedded naturally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The set and frozenset Class\n",
    "\n",
    "* The major advantage of using a set is that it has a highly optimized method for checking weather a specific element is contained in the set.\n",
    "* Only instances of __immutable__ types can be added to a Python set.\n",
    "* The frozenset class is an immutable form of the set type, so it is legal to have a set of frozensets.\n",
    "* The exception rule is that { } does not represent an empty set; it represents an empty dictionary. set() produces an empty set.\n",
    "* If an iterable parameter is sent to the constructor, then the set of distinct elements is produced. (e.g., set('hello') produces {'h','e','l','l','o'})\n",
    "\n",
    "### The dict Class\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python's __dict__ class represents a __dictionary__, or __mapping__, from a set of distinct __keys__ to associated __values__.\n",
    "* The constructor accepts a sequence of key-value pairs as a parameter, as in <span style=\"font-family:Gothic;\">dict(pairs)</span> with <span style=\"font-family:Gothic;\">pairs = [('ga','Irish'),('de','German')]</span>."
